# ClassificationProject1
This is ML KNN classification project.

I have used sklearn for KNN.
CV is performed to chosse 'k', sklearn caluculate distance for each k which increases execution time drastically.
Large execution time is current issue in this implementaion.

Different feature reduction methods are analyzed.

Futher versions might be imporved to perform fast.
